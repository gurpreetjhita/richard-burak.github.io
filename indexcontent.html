    The next step is to put the basic hardware of the project together. The circuit has been planned out, and now must be built and tested. I must also find time to solder together the PCB.<br>
    The three of us working on the project have previously made a simple light sensor circuit together. I plan to use the same circuit to measure light for the project.<br>

    We also got together to create the same circuit for the project. Using Fritzing, we created a layout. This will be constructed and tested in the lab period.<br>

    With the budget proposed, I now understand the materials required. Anything that I am not in possession of will be ordered from RobotShop, or purchased from Sayal. A log of the items will be posted once the they have arrived.<br>

    In the first week, we were instructed to make an LED blink on a Raspberry Pi. This lab was meant to teach us how to use and interface with the Pi.<br>
