	<H3>i - Build Instructions - Intro</H3>
	<p>
		This page will host the intructions to build the solar panel project, which was designed by Salvatore Angilletta, Richard Burak (myself), and Steven Spiteri. It will describe how to reproduce our project,
		and anyone following this should be able to successfully replicate it.
	</p>

 <SECTION ID="Section_12">
	<H3>ii - System Diagram</H3>
	<p>
		First, the idea of the project must be understood. The goal is to read data from a solar panel, and then allow an easy means of viewing this data. This build instruction will show you how to display this data on the
		Raspberry Pi 3 and view it remotely through SSH and VNC.

	<H3>iii - Budget and Materials</H3>
	<p>
		Required materials are listed in the table below. Some materials (soldering iron access, multimeter access, custom PCB, acrylic box) were available through Humber College, but an effort has been made to price these items.
		Using external sources to create the custom PCB and box may have varying prices, and quotes would be required on a personal basis. More detailed information about the pricing, as well as a list of more materials/tools 
		that may be used can be found in the budget Excel files hosted on this website. An important thing to note is the required access to a desktop computer, and a network. A keyboard/mouse along with an HDMI display are required
		to setup the Raspberry Pi 3, and the network is required to update the Pi and remotely access it.

	<H3>iv - Time Commitment</H3>
	<p>
		This project has been worked on throughout my 5th Semester at Humber College, and in the end will take me about 15 weeks to complete. With these instructions, the time required should be cut down significantly,
		and the research and setup has taken up most of my time. The table below shows the approximate time required to perform each task. This project could be completed in less than a month, even with a busy schedule.

		The tasks above are recommended to be completed in order, but do not necessarily have to. The step-by-step guide will go in the order of the above tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		First you must order the required parts. It is preferable that the parts are the same as the ones linked above, but any compatible part can be used. It could take up to 2 weeks for parts to arrive, but they can arrive at
		any timne after ordering. Digi-Key items arrived in less than 24 hours, while some other items took over a week. It is best to order everything at once to ensure all the required materials are together. Once the
		Raspberry Pi 3 arrives, you may begin Step 1.
	</p>
 </SECTION>
 
 <SECTION ID="Section_10">
	<H3>Step 1: Raspberry Pi Setup</H3>
	<p>
		Once the Raspberry Pi 3 has arrived, begin by connecting it to a display. Next, connect the keyboard and mouse. You can now plug the Pi into power and begin configuring the Raspbian OS. The setup will be explained on
		screen, and you may begin using the Pi once it has completed.<br>
		In the top right-hand corner of the screen, select the network you want the Pi to automatically connect to when it boots up (skip this step if the device is using a wired connection). Be sure to make note of the IP address,
		as it is required later to remotely connect to the device. The IP can be found by hovering the mouse over the WiFi symbol on the top-right.<br>
		Once connected to the internet, open the command line terminal and run the following command:<br> 
		<pre><code> sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
		This will update th Pi to the most recent version. This is important, as security updates are required to keep the device safe.<br>
		Next, SSH must be enabled by default, otherwise you will not be able to remotely access the Pi. To ensure SSH starts when the Pi is botted up, run this in the command line:<br><br>
		<pre><code> mv /boot/boot_enable_ssh.rc /boot/boot.rc</code></pre>
		Now that SSH is enabled, VNC must be installed and enabled. VNC allows users to navigate the GUI of the Pi remotely. To install this, run the following commands:<br><br> 
		<pre><code> sudo install tightvncserver
 tightvncserver</code></pre>
		Setup a password for VNC when asked. You will now be able to run VNC server by accessing the Pi through SSH, then interface using any VNC client.<br>
		To prepare the Pi for use with the sensors, I2C must be enabled. To do this, start by running the following command:<br><br>
		<pre><code> sudo raspi-config</code></pre>
		Use the arrow keys to navigate to advanced options and hit enter. Once there, navigate to I2C and hit enter again. Select "Yes" to have I2C enabled on the Pi.<br>
		Next, we must prepare the Python program used to interface with the sensors. The program below (solar.py) will show the data gathered by the sensors in the circuit. It will not successfully run
		until all the sensors have been successfully connected.<br>
		<a href="../BuildFiles/solar.py">Download - solar.py</a><br>
		Simply place the file in any directory on the Pi.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the Pi now configured, we can move on to the hardware part of this project.
	</p>

 <SECTION ID="Section_9">
	<H3>Step 2: PCB Soldering/Testing</H3>
	<p>
		The main PCB that holds the I2C circuits, called the Modular Sensor Hat, was provided by Humber College. The board must first be printed, and the components aquired (from the Prototype Lab in J building).
		Solder the components provided according to the Eagle .brd and .sch files. Be sure to wear safety glasses while soldering, and consider all aspects of your own (and others') safety. (Also remember to change my
		name to yours, for that personal touch!)

		<img src="../Images/msh_pcb_sch.png" alt="MSH Schematic" style="width:600px;height:400px;"><br>
		Caution: There is a problem with the Modular Sensor Hat, I have included a quote from our instructor regarding the problem below.
		<blockquote>
			<i> 
				"RTC module can charge the CR2032 battery causing damage. To permanently disable the charging circuit, please remove the 200 ohm surface mount resistor near the unused I2C header by 
				pushing it off the PCB with a hot soldering iron."
			</i>
		</blockquote> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the addition custom PCB must be printed and soldered. The materials required for this step are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>10K Resistor (From Pi Starter Kit)</li>
			<li>5-pin Header (x2)</li>
			<li>2x20 pin GPIO Header</li>
			<li>Short pieces of 22 gauge wire (x3)</li>
		</ul>

		<a href="../BuildFiles/solarpanel2.sch">Download - Custom PCB, EAGLE Schematic File</a><br>
		<img src="../Images/pcb_brd.png" alt="Board" style="width:600px;height:400px;"><br>
		<img src="../Images/pcb_sch.png" alt="Schematic" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><br>
		Looking at the board above, be sure to insert the GPIO header from the bottom of the board, and the 5-pin headers from the top. The 3 short wires are required for the vias (which connect the top and bottom of
		the board). Also, make sure to solder the top-left end of the GPIO header, to ensure it is sturdy and does not move around.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final step with the boards is to ensure all the connections are working before connecting them. If faulty boards are connected to sensors (or the Pi) they can cause permanent damage to either. Save youself time 
		(and money) by making sure they work before continuing. To do this, power and ground the boards first. Apply 3.3V to pin 1, and ground pin 6. Now we need the digital multimeter. Connect the multimeter to the same
		ground as the Pi, and use the other connection to probe the different parts of the circuit. Measure both resistance and voltage, to make sure the values are correct. If any problems are detected, resoldering may
		be required.<br>

	</p>
	<p>
		If the boards pass all the tests, then you are ready to move on to Step 3.
	</p>
 </SECTION>
 
 <SECTION ID="Section_8">
	<H3>Step 3: Unit Testing Sensors</H3>
	<p>
		To test the sensors, first connect the Modular Sensor Hat to your Raspberry Pi. Next, connect the barometric pressure sensor to the 4-pin header labelled "DS-RTC", making sure to match the labels on the board 
		and breakout. Next, connect the YL-40 board provided in the Humber components pack to the neighbouring 4-pin header labelled "PCF - ADC".
